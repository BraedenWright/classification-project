Project Goal
---------------------
The ultimate objective is to determine the main drivers behind churn for our customers, and then to build a model that will predict  future customer churn.



Project Description
-------------------


With the implimentaion of 5G networks across the country and the recent increase of people working from home, it is important now more than ever that we provide satisfation to our customers to retain their business.  Here we will analyze our current customer base (with a focus on those whose churned) and determine what were some of the key factors in their depature from Telco. Furthermore we can find out how likely those factors were to contribute to a customer churning, thus giving us an idea of what measure we can take to keep those at risk customers from churning.



Initial Questions
---------------------

Your readme should include initial questions and focus you are going into the analysis with. This is an important part of project planning and gives context to the reader about where you started, what were your initial ideas and thoughts, and did those play out to be true.

For example:

Was the phrase "women and children first" just a myth or did they really try to get out women and children first? If so, they would show as more likely to survive.

Do those who travel first class get quicker access to life boats?

Do families with small children get priority access? Even if they at the bottom of the boat in 3rd class?

Data Dictionary
---------------------

Your readme should include a data dictionary, which is important to provide in order to define and disambiguate each of the variables you are analyzing.

For example:
Variable 	Meaning
Survived 	
	
Steps to Reproduce
----------------------

Your readme should include useful and adequate instructions for reproducing your analysis and final report.

For example:

    You will need an env.py file that contains the hostname, username and password of the mySQL database that contains the titanic_db.passengers table. Store that env file locally in the repository.
    clone my repo (including the acquireTitanic.py and prepare.Titanic.py) (confirm .gitignore is hiding your env.py file)
    libraries used are pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn.
    you should be able to run survival_report.

The Plan
------------------------

Your readme should include a project plan which helps guide both the user and yourself through the different stages of the pipeline and steps you took to get to your conclusion.
